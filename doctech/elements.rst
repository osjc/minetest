Nodes and objects
=================

Nodes
-----

All the nodes behave exactly the same, they differ only in their looks.
Except for the "Light" which emits light and "Water" which is partially
transparent.

"Air" is the empty space.

"Water" is actually much more of a kind of "blue acrylate" than real
water. It does not flow and can be digged out and used to build stuff like
any other node out there. It is partially transparent.

"Grass" is a green block that turns into "grass with footsteps" when the
player steps on it.

"Grass With Footsteps" looks like grass with brown footsteps on it. It forms
from the "grass" when a player steps on it and can be collected normally
(won't turn back to "Grass" when mined).

"Mud" is found under "grass" and under "water". At water level the grass is
not present and the "mud" is exposed. It is dark brown.

"Stone" is a light gray block found below the "grass" and "mud". Sometimes
the stone is exposed. It is more likely to be exposed on steep slopes.

"Trunk" is a gray block that forms the barks of the trees. The trees are all
looking the same.

"Leaves" are dark green blocks that form the crowns of the trees and the
"bushes" which are just a block of leaves on the ground.

"Light" is a white textureless block that emits light. Placing it in dark
underground caves allows one to explore them.

Objects
-------

"Sign" is a sign that can be placed somewhere. The signs shows "Example Sign
Text" when they are pointed at.

"Rat" is a moving object that randomly moves to and fro and occasionally
jumps. It resembles a cardboard cutout of a rat-like creature but is green
with yellow eyes.
