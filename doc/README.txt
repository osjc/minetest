An InfiniMiner/Minecraft inspired game.

This is a development version:
- Don't expect it to work as well as a finished game will.
- Please report any bugs to me. That way I can fix them to the next release.
	- debug.txt is very useful when the game crashes.

Public servers:
	kray.dy.fi :30000 (friend's server - usually in creative mode)
	celer.oni.biz :30000 (main development server)
- Both of these have very limited bandwidth and the game will become laggy
  with 4-5 players.
- If you want to run a server, I can list you on my website and in here.

Features, as of now:
- Almost Infinite Map (limited to +-31000 blocks in any direction at the moment)
    - Minecraft alpha has a height restriction of 128 blocks
- Map Generator capable of taking advantage of the infinite map

Controls:
- WASD+mouse: Move
- Mouse L: Dig
- Mouse R: Place block
- Mouse Wheel: Change item
- F: Change item
- R: Toggle full view range

Configuration file:
- An optional configuration file can be used. See minetest.conf.example.
- Path to file can be passed as a parameter to the executable.
- If not given as a parameter, these are checked, in order:
	../minetest.conf
	../../minetest.conf

Running on Windows:
- The working directory should be ./bin

Running on GNU/Linux:
- fasttest is a linux binary compiled on a recent Arch Linux installation.
  It should run on most recent GNU/Linux distributions.
- Browse to the game ./bin directory and type:
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./fasttest
- If it doesn't work, use wine. I aim at 100% compatibility with wine.

Compiling on GNU/Linux:
- You need:
* Irrlicht:
	http://downloads.sourceforge.net/irrlicht/irrlicht-1.7.2.zip
* JThread:
	http://research.edm.uhasselt.be/~jori/page/index.php?n=CS.Jthread
- Neither of which can probably be found from your distro's repository.
- Compiling each of them should be fairly unproblematic, though.

Compiling on Windows:
- Be sure to
  #define JMUTEX_CRITICALSECTION
  in jmutex.h before compiling it. Otherwise mutexes will be very slow.
